I started learning Power BI a month ago and am now excited to share my first project on LinkedIn, which will also be available on GitHub soon.

Here is my Power BI journey, transforming raw data into insights:

*Data Overview:* This project focuses on HR Employee Attrition metrics, providing organizations insights into workforce stability and satisfaction by depicting job satisfaction rates, average hourly working hours, and identifying top and bottom performers etc

*KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):*
- Number of employees by Department and Gender
- Total employees doing Overtime (Yes/No)
- Percentage of Male and Female employees (calculated and displayed using measures)
- Job satisfaction ratings (1 and 2 as BAD, else GOOD)
- Identification of best and bottom performers based on performance ratings (3 and 4 stars)
- Employees categorized by Business Travel frequency
- Count of Marital Status using 3 categories
- Number of employees who have left
- Average hourly cost (rate) of employees displayed using a chart
- Count of total employees by Job roles
- Employees working under current managers for more than 5 years

*Project Overview:*
Every raw dataset was analyzed and refined through data cleaning using the Power Query window. Various DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and measure functions were utilized to calculate KPIs accurately. This process was crucial for creating effective visualizations that communicate actionable insights.

I believe continuous learning and practice are key to ongoing improvement. I'm open to any piece of advice that you might have for my betterment and improvement that could contribute to my growth.

Thank You
